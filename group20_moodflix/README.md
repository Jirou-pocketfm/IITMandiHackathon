## 🔍 How It Works

### Conversation Flow Graph Explained

The LangGraph conversation workflow orchestrates the movie recommendation process through several key stages:

1. **Initial Query Analysis** - When a user first interacts with the system, it:
   - Analyzes whether any preferences are already mentioned
   - Either asks for the user's mood or proceeds to recommendation generation

2. **Progressive Preference Collection** - The system follows a carefully designed conversation flow:
   - 🎭 **Mood Collection** - "What mood are you in for a movie today?"
   - 🎬 **Genre Collection** - "What genre would you like to watch?"
   - 📊 **Subgenre Refinement** - "Do you have a specific subgenre preference?"
   - ⏱️ **Length Preference** - "Do you prefer short, medium, or long movies?"
   - 📚 **Similar Movies** - "Are there any movies you've enjoyed that you'd like to see something similar to?"
   - 🌟 **Actor Preferences** - "Are there any specific actors you wish to see in your movie?"

3. **Knowledge Retrieval and Processing**:
   - **Semantic or Keyword Search** - The system dynamically determines whether to perform semantic similarity search or keyword-based retrieval
   - **External Information Integration** - Supplements internal movie database with web search results
   - **Content Enhancement** - Combines multiple knowledge sources for comprehensive recommendations

4. **Response Generation** - For each step, the system:
   - Provides relevant movie recommendations based on preferences collected so far
   - Formats results with titles, ratings, and brief descriptions
   - Clearly separates the introduction text, movie list, and next question

This directed graph architecture enables the system to maintain context throughout the conversation while adapting to user inputs and progressively refining recommendations.
